# Multiple-Operations-Question
Random Project: Taking input from user and performing different tasks.
Depending upon the user input, sysytem has to perform the different operations:

Case1: Find palindrome of number.
Palindrome numbers: A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when digits are reversed. For example, 
the number 12321, 10101, 56565 are palindrome numbers, but 1451 is not a palindrome number.

Case2: Print Pattern for a given no.
If the input is 5
*****
****
***
**
*
If the input is 6
******
*****
****
***
**
*
and so on...

Case3: Check whether the no is a  prime number.
>>>A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. 
A factor is a whole number that can be divided evenly into another number. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29. 

Case4: Print Fibonacci series.
The sequence follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. 
The Fibonacci sequence begins with the following 6 integers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.
>>>Keep the initial digits as 0 and 1, depending upon the user input "n", generate the Fibonacci Series of "n" digits.

Input: 5
Fibonacci Series: 0,1,1,2,3

Input: 8
Fibonacci Series: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13

and so on...
